# Soft Arcade

**Spring 2021 ||  Make Learning Labs Deep Dive**

*Why do we mash plastic buttons during play instead of squishing, pulling, cutting, stroking, or weaving softer materials to explore a game space? What possibilities lie beyond the plastic?* 

In this two week course, you will design a custom game controller using electronic textile or eTextile materials and making practices. Week 1 will include a mixture of material exploration and experimentation, sensor making, design exercises, game design fundamentals, signal processing, and flexible textile PCB design. In week 2 you will be given a design brief to create a personalized textile controller through a process of brainstorming, prototyping, debugging, and playtesting. As a playful collective, we will reflect on and critique the cultural values inscribed in traditional game controllers as a core part of our work. We will focus on taking time to craft care into our soft controllers and community. 


## Schedule
### Week 1
- [Day 1: Introduction](https://github.com/lizastark/soft-arcade/tree/main/Days/Day_1)
(overview, materials exploration, game design exercise)
- [Day 2: Crafting Sensors + Guiding Electricity](https://github.com/lizastark/soft-arcade/blob/main/Days/Day_2.md) (review electricity, knit a custom sensor, sewing 101)
- [Day 3: Interacting with the Screen](https://github.com/lizastark/soft-arcade/blob/main/Days/Day_3.md) (meet the Teensy LC, reading data from a sensor, HIDs)
- [Day 4: Tracing Materials](https://github.com/lizastark/soft-arcade/blob/main/Days/Day_4.md) (hard/soft connections, make a fabric pcb)
- Day 5: Project: Brainstorming (design exercise, flex/review time)


### Week 2
- Day 6: Project: Prototyping (pitches, prototyping techniques, scoping)
- Day 7: Project: Playtesting (how to playtest, giving/receiving feedback)
- Day 8: Project: Prototyping (debugging, optional playtest)
- Day 9: Project: Refining & Documenting (making it look nice, documentation)
- Day 10: Project: Game Jam & Wrap up (game jam, more documentation, taking it further)


## Tools and Systems
### Overview
- Communication: Discord
- Submitting asynchronous work: Discord
- Documentation: Make, personal sites
- Course documentation: GitHub, Google Slides, [Are.na](https://www.are.na/liza-stark/soft-arcade)
- Office hours: Discord

### Office hours
We all have strengths and knowledge to share. Liza or Elizabeth with be available most days for office hours, but you will also be required to sign up for one day of office hours. 

### Debugging best practices
Bugs happens to all of us! Things break! That's ok - it's the best way to learn. See the [debugging.md](https://github.com/lizastark/soft-arcade/blob/main/debugging.md) file for more.
