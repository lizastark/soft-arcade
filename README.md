# Soft Arcade

**Spring 2021 ||  Make Learning Labs Deep Dive**

*Why do we mash plastic buttons during play instead of squishing, pulling, cutting, stroking, or weaving softer materials to explore a game space? What possibilities lie beyond the plastic?* 

In this two week course, you will design a custom game controller using electronic textile or eTextile materials and making practices. Week 1 will include a mixture of material exploration and experimentation, sensor making, design exercises, game design fundamentals, signal processing, and flexible textile PCB design. In week 2 you will be given a design brief to create a personalized textile controller through a process of brainstorming, prototyping, debugging, and playtesting. As a playful collective, we will reflect on and critique the cultural values inscribed in traditional game controllers as a core part of our work. We will focus on taking time to craft care into our soft controllers and community.
