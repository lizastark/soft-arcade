## Conductive Materials

### Copper taffeta fabric 
This extremely conductive fabric is relatively low cost and great for making circuit traces.

**Material Info**
- Distributor: [lessEMF](https://www.lessemf.com/fabric4.html#11212)
- Resistivity: 0.05 [Ohm/sq](https://www.lessemf.com/faq-shie.html#ohms)
- Base: Polyester
- Conductor: Copper plated

**Uses**
- Fabric PCB
- Circuit traces (any time you need to connect two components)
- Switches and tilt sensors

**Techniques**
 - Sewn with regular or conductive thread by hand or in sewing machine.
 - Ironed down onto fabric using fusible interfacing. Remember to keep your iron at a low temp (e.g. poly) and cover the material while you iron it to prevent melting. If this happens, it fuses the plating and polyester which causes the resistance to INCREASE.
 - Cuts well with a vinyl cutter or laser cutter
