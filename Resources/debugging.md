## Debugging process

When something isn't working the way it's supposed to, here's a general process strategy you can follow. I adapted and condensed this check list from two amazing resources that you should familiarize yourself with: an ITP video series called[A Brief Introduction to Debugging](https://vimeo.com/channels/debugging) from Clay Shirky and [A Field Guide to Debugging](https://p5js.org/learn/debugging.html) by the p5.js community.

 **1. Put yourself in the right mindset for debugging**
Chances are you will only find a bug after you’ve spent a lot of time and invested a lot of energy into your code. You might need to go pet your dog, get a snack, take a walk, or even sleep on it before diving in. Debugging should happen slowly and methodically. If you are moving fast, you will likely miss something or create new bugs.

**2. Go back to basics**
Are you connected to the internet? Is your code editor or IDE (i.e integrated developer environment) functioning properly? Does your browser need to restart for an update? It might sound silly...until it fixes everything.

**3. Make a copy**
Trying to fix problems can lead to more problems. Always make a copy if you need to make any big changes. Better safe than sorry!

**4. Start simple**
Check the simple things first. This is a process of elimination, so get the easy ones out of the way. Search for ground-level errors and check for mistakes in syntax in your code and crossed traces or short circuits in your circuit. Think about the materials you're using. Are they too resistive for the distance you need? 

**5. Search for patterns**
Programming, like other human languages, relies on patterns as a way to organize and make sense of your code. We can use patterns that we’ve seen in past code and apply them to a current challenge. For example, let’s say you are programming a button to decrease the score each time it’s clicked. You’ve already coded two buttons to increase the score, but you’re not sure how to program the second. You can observe similarities or patterns in their behavior to help you find a solution.

**6. Describe the problem**
Sometimes when we look at a problem on our own for too long, we start skipping over the simple things. But if you have to describe the problem to someone else, you have to be more detailed. Pretend you are telling or writing a friend about your problem and describe:
- What you have already done.
- What is going wrong.
- What you expected or want to happen.
- What additions or changes you made in your code or circuit since the last time you tested it.
your planning notes, pseudocode, and/or diagrams too. Chances are you’ll spot the mistake on

**8. Test one thing at a time**
Here’s one scenario we definitely do not want: by changing a few “small things” in your code, you create a new problem and now you can’t figure out if it’s the old problem or the new changes causing it. Your goal is to isolate the problem. Change one thing at a time, then test it.

**9. Search the interwebs**
There are a ton of websites devoted entirely to answering questions about code errors. Chances are pretty good that someone else has encountered your problem. Once you’ve described your problem in detail, use your favorite search engine to find some answers. If nothing comes up, try reframing or rewording your question - being able to search for a solution efficiently is a skill in itself! 

**10. Ask a friend**
If you still can’t figure it out after trying everything above, phone in a friend, mentor, or teacher. Remember to include your code ([codeshare.io](codeshare.io) can be helpful for this) and take pictures of your circuit from multiple angles. A diagram is also helpful!
