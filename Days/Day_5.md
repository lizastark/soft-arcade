Come prepared to pitch your project ideas for feedback! 
Think about these questions:
- What will you make? What is the interaction? What is the interface? Do you have a theme, emotion, or game in mind? Has this been made before? If so, what can you learn from that project?
- Who are you making it for? Are there any special considerations you need to think about?
- Why are you making this? What are the goals of your project?
- How will you make it?  What materials do you need? What additional research or support do you need to undertake?
