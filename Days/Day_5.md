### Asynchronous assignment
1. Review the [brief](https://github.com/lizastark/soft-arcade/blob/main/project_brief.md) and slides from Week 1. We covered A LOT and it will be helpful to have a refresher!
2. Brainstorm a project idea based on the brief. Think about these questions:
- What will you make? What is the interaction? What is the interface? Do you have a theme, emotion, or game in mind? Has this been made before? If so, what can you learn from that project?
- Who are you making it for? Are there any special considerations you need to think about?
- Why are you making this? What are the goals of your project?
- How will you make it?  What materials do you need? What additional research or support do you need to undertake?
Create sketches or diagrams for a visual reference. If you want to start any physical prototyping you can also do that!
3. Add your pitch to your slide on [this deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qAax8E3L6yW25_Ak7d9LvAT4hhtrIlwbe6P8-Sh1okk/edit#slide=id.g4fff4d02ae_0_162). You can have up to three slides if you need them.
