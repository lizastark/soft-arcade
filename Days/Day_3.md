### Tutorials

### Reference
- [Teensy USB Keyboard](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_keyboard.html) with keycodes. *Note that this only supports the English alphabet. i have not been able to find good documentation to support other keyboard layouts yet, but am working on it.*
- [Teensy USB Mouse](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_mouse.html)
- [Debouncing a button](https://www.programmingelectronics.com/debouncing-a-button-with-arduino/). This has a good overview of a button's rising and falling edges.

### Asynchronous assignment
**1. GGJ Challenge.** 
Design and build an HID system around the theme: Lost & Found. You should build a new switch and/ or sensor and connect it to the Teensy LC to generate an intentional output. The controller and the output should You might:
- Write a letter to a friend you haven’t seen (e.g. type with switch)
- Guide a kitty home from an errand. (e.g. control keyboard arrows with touch)
- Search for a treasure or identity among ruins (e.g. move mouse with both sensor)
This is a *prototype* meant to prepare you for next week. You can use a premade game/program or prototype one with a text editor, p5.js, etc.
