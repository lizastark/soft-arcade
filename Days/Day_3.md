### Asynchronous assignment
**1. GGJ Challenge.** 
Design and build an HID system around the theme: Lost & Found. You should build a new switch and/ or sensor and connect it to the Teensy LC to generate an intentional output. The controller and the output should You might:
- Write a letter to a friend you havenâ€™t seen (e.g. type with switch)
- Guide a kitty home from an errand. (e.g. control keyboard arrows with touch)
- Search for a treasure or identity among ruins (e.g. move mouse with both sensor)
This is a *prototype* meant to prepare you for next week. You can use a premade game/program or prototype one with a text editor, p5.js, etc.
