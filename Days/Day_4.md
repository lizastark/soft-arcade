### Asynchronous assignment
**1. Practice making your own fabric PCB.** Try to make one trace of conductive fabric and one with conductive thread. 

Here are a few ideas: Use the circuit from the beginning of class or you can. Make a fabric PCB to connect to three Teensy touch pins. Each time you touch a trace, a new message should print to the serial monitor.

**2. Prepare your materials for Day 5.**
