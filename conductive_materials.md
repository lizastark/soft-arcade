# Conductive 
These materials are extremely conductive and good for connecting components in a circuit or building switches.

## Copper taffeta fabric 
This extremely conductive fabric is relatively low cost and great for making circuit traces. 

**Material Info**
- Distributor: [lessEMF](https://www.lessemf.com/fabric4.html#11212)
- Resistivity: 0.05 [Ohm/sq](https://www.lessemf.com/faq-shie.html#ohms)
- Base: Polyester
- Conductor: Copper plated

**Uses**
- Fabric PCB
- Circuit traces (any time you need to connect two components)
- Switches and tilt sensors

**Techniques**
 - Sewn with regular or conductive thread by hand or in sewing machine.
 - Ironed down onto fabric using fusible interfacing. Remember to keep your iron at a low temp (e.g. poly) and cover the material while you iron it to prevent melting. If this happens, it fuses the plating and polyester which causes the resistance to INCREASE.
 - Cuts well with a vinyl cutter or laser cutter

## Conductive ribbon
This ribbon is woven with three discrete lines of conductive material (tinsel strands). This means the lines do not connect, so you could hold ground, power, and signal lines all on one ribbon.

**Material Info**
- Distributor: Sparkfun
- Resistivity: 0.3 Ohm/meter
- Base: Polyester
- Conductor: Tinsel

**Uses**
- Circuit traces that require connecting 1-3 discrete components.

**Techniques**
 - Sewn with conductive thread 
 - Solderable

# Resistive 
These materials are resistive - they are not as conductive. This makes them perfect for fabricating customized sensors. Their resistance will change with distance, pressure, and surface area.
