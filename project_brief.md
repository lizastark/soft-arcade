## Project Brief

**Use the materials, tools, and techniques you learned this week to build a controller as a gift for someone you care about.** You will document your design process and the final controller on your personal site or on Make Projects. 

Your controller must use at least one soft switch or sensor that you built with the tools, materials, and techniques we covered this week. Your controller can control a screen-based game using the Teensy as HID (e.g. a pressure sensor to move a Pong paddle) OR it can be a standalone controller for a game (e.g. Simon Says). 

Tips:
- Think about specific mechanics, emotion/feelings, and/or narratives that inspire you.
- Keep it simple. Choose a game like pong, space invaders, pac man or another classic arcade game. 
- Choose one material you want to learn more about to work with in depth.
- Come up with a big idea and make one part of it.
